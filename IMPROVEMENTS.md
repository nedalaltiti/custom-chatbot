# HR Bot Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Redundant Responses Fixed
- **Problem**: Bot was giving generic "Contact HR department" responses to simple greetings like "hi"
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `processor.py` to handle cases where RAG doesn't find documents more gracefully
  - Bot now falls back to direct LLM responses for general conversation
  - Only shows "contact HR" when truly unable to help

### 2. Proper Conversation Flow
- **Problem**: Bot wasn't properly asking "Is there anything else I can help you with?" and handling responses
- **Solution**:
  - Removed regex that was stripping the "anything else?" question
  - Added state tracking (`awaiting_more_help`) to handle yes/no responses
  - When user says "yes" or similar: Bot asks "What would you like to know?"
  - When user says "no" or similar: Bot thanks them and shows feedback card
  - If user asks a new question directly, bot processes it normally

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- **Problem**: Bot responses were slow due to multiple API calls
- **Solution**:
  - Added caching to vector store similarity searches (1-hour TTL by default)
  - Added performance settings to control behavior
  - Optimized streaming to only activate for longer responses
  - Removed unnecessary intent classification calls for simple messages

### 4. Teams-Compliant Streaming with Informative Updates
- **Problem**: Users wanted better visual feedback during bot processing
- **Solution**: Implemented proper Microsoft Teams streaming protocol
  - **Informative Updates**: Blue progress bar shows:
    - "Connecting..." when first connecting with the bot
    - "I'm analyzing your request..." while processing
  - **Response Streaming**: Shows typing indicator with progressive text updates
  - **Clean Experience**: Informative updates appear in the UI without cluttering chat history
  - **Follows Teams Best Practices**: Uses official streamType and streamSequence protocol

## Key Changes Made

### teams.py
- Replaced `_ENDING_RE` with `_HAS_ANYTHING_ELSE_RE` to detect questions
- Added `awaiting_more_help` state tracking
- Improved greeting handling to avoid redundant processing
- Added quick intent detection for explicit goodbye messages
- Better handling of yes/no responses to "anything else?" question
- **NEW**: Teams-compliant streaming implementation:
  - Shows "Connecting..." for first-time users
  - Uses `stream_message_with_info()` for proper informative updates
  - "I'm analyzing your request..." appears as blue progress bar during processing

### teams_adapter.py
- **NEW**: Added Teams streaming protocol support:
  - `send_informative_update()` - Sends blue progress bar updates
  - `_TeamsStreamerWithInfo` class - Handles full streaming flow
  - Proper `streamType` handling: "informative" → "streaming" → "final"
  - Correct `streamSequence` numbering
  - Follows Microsoft's throttling recommendations

### processor.py  
- Changed from always using RAG to checking if RAG is appropriate
- Falls back to direct LLM when RAG finds no documents
- More natural error handling and responses

### settings.py
- Added `PerformanceSettings` dataclass with:
  - `use_intent_classification`: Toggle Gemini-based intent classification
  - `cache_embeddings`: Enable/disable caching
  - `cache_ttl_seconds`: Cache time-to-live
  - `min_streaming_length`: Minimum response length for streaming

### vector_store.py
- Added simple in-memory cache for similarity searches
- Cache automatically expires after TTL
- Cache is cleared when documents are updated
- Automatic cleanup when cache gets too large (>100 entries)

## Configuration Options

You can now control performance via environment variables:
```bash
# Disable intent classification for faster responses
export USE_INTENT_CLASSIFICATION=false

# Enable/disable caching (default: true)
export CACHE_EMBEDDINGS=true

# Set cache TTL in seconds (default: 3600 = 1 hour)
export CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=3600

# Minimum response length for streaming (default: 100 chars)
export MIN_STREAMING_LENGTH=100
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Flexible State Management**: Uses state tracking instead of hardcoded flows
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to direct LLM when RAG isn't needed
3. **Performance Optimization**: Caching and conditional processing
4. **Natural Conversation Flow**: Properly handles conversation endings
5. **User Experience**: Faster responses through optimization
6. **Teams-Compliant Streaming**: Follows Microsoft's official streaming protocol

## Expected Behavior

1. **First Connection**: User says "hi" → Sees blue "Connecting..." → Welcome card appears
2. **Processing Messages**: User asks question → Sees blue "I'm analyzing your request..." → Response streams in
3. User asks HR question → Bot provides answer + "Is there anything else?"
4. User says "yes" → Bot asks "What would you like to know?"
5. User says "no" → Bot thanks them and shows feedback card
6. User asks new question directly → Bot answers normally
7. Responses are faster due to caching and optimizations
8. Professional Teams experience with proper informative updates

## Streaming Details

The bot now implements Microsoft Teams' streaming protocol:
- **Informative Updates**: Blue progress bar at bottom of chat
- **Response Streaming**: Text appears progressively as typing indicator
- **No Chat Clutter**: Progress messages don't appear in conversation history
- **Smooth Transitions**: Informative → Streaming → Final message flow
- **Throttle Protection**: 1 request/second limit respected
